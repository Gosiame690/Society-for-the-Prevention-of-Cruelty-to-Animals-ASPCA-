Student Number: ST10448523

Module: WEDE5020 — Web Development

Assignment: Part 3 — Functionality, Enhancement and Optimization

Part 3 Changes Completed:

JavaScript Fixes and Enhancements:

The script file reference was corrected on all pages. Previously, the website attempted to load a file named main.javascript, which did not exist. This was replaced with the correct script file (script.js).

The navigation menu (hamburger menu) was made functional on smaller screens. This allows users to toggle the menu open and closed on mobile devices.

Navigation Structure Improvements:

Duplicate navigation tags and incorrect menu structure were replaced with a clean, uniform navigation bar across all pages.

Added a container named “nav-links” to ensure the JavaScript functionality works properly to open and close the menu on smaller screens.

Dynamic Interactivity Feature (Required for Part 3):

A live search feature was added to the Gallery page.

Users can now type into a search bar and the displayed animals/images filter automatically without refreshing the page.

This fulfills the Part 3 requirement for a JavaScript-based interactive element.

Additional Page Adjustments:

The adoption page cards/images were adjusted to maintain consistent formatting.

The enquiry page allows users to submit general communication or contact messages. Input validation ensures all required fields are filled before submission.

2. Form Layout Improved

Before:

Form inputs appeared on one long horizontal line.

No spacing between fields.

After:

4. Form Submission Feedback

SEO and Accessibility Enhancements:

Meta descriptions and keywords were added to support search engine indexing.

Added alternative text descriptions to all images for accessibility.

Implemented image organization improvements so the website structure is easier to manage.

Files Added:
script.js (JavaScript functionality)
enquiry.html (General enquiry form page)
robots.txt (Ensures search engines can access the site)
sitemap.xml (Helps search engines crawl the structure of the site)

Key Outcomes:
