   <h2>Our History</h2>  
   <p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) is a historic nonprofit organization based in New York City, founded in 1866, making it the oldest animal welfare organization in the United States. The ASPCA opened its first veterinary hospital in 1912. It offered free veterinary care for horses, dogs, and cats. The organization is known for its various initiatives, including a 24-hour animal poison control hotline, mobile spay and neuter clinics, and efforts to rescue animals from disasters and combat cruelty, such as dog fighting and puppy mills. It has achieved significant milestones in animal rescue and the organization is recognized for its impactful public awareness campaigns, though there has been controversy surrounding the perception of how donations are utilized. Overall, the ASPCA continues to play a crucial role in advocating for animals and promoting humane treatment across the United States. Beginning in 1890, the ASPCA had a contract with New York City in which it acted as animal control.</p>    </body>
